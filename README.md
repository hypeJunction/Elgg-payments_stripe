## Features

 * API for handling payments via Stripe

## Acknowledgements

 * Plugin has been sponsored by [Social Business World] (https://socialbusinessworld.org "Social Business World")

## Notes

### Example

See actions/payments/checkout/stripe.php for usage example.

### Payment Status

You can use `'transaction:<status>', 'payments'` hooks to apply additional logic upon payment status changes.
Payments are synchronous and do not require a user to be forwarded to another location.

### Web hook events

Make sure to setup the webhooks via your Stripe dashboard. Webhook URL is listed in plugin settings.
Charge-related hooks will be digested by the plugin automatically. Other web hook event data can be digested with `'digest:webhook', 'stripe'` plugin hook.

### SSL

### Credentials
